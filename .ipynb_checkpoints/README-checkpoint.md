# Tensor Network and Machine Learning

Tensor networks have been very useful in the study of quantum many-body systems as a way to deal with the curse of dimensionality, where the dimension of the Hilbert space increases exponentially with the number of particles of the system. Borrowing the intuition from physics, tensor networks have been recently incorporated in machine learning algorithms. To my knowledge, the first concrete tensor network algorithm applied to a machine learning task is due to Stoudenmire and Schwab in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05775).

In this repository we use the library [TensorNetwork](https://github.com/google/TensorNetwork) which makes the use of tensor networks for machine learning easily acessible for the non-physicist community.
